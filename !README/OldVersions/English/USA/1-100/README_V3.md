On 2022, Tuesday, July 19th, upon starting my computer, I found that my [main account](https://github.com/seanpm2001/) had been flagged. It retained functionality, except for images not rendering (but none of the files being corrupted) and my entire account being hidden from public view. I have sent a repeal on 2022, July 19th, but as of 3:10 pm PST on 2022 July 22nd, I have received no response.

## Usage of alt account

I was advised to make a message via my alt account. I have been hesitant to do so, as I fear it could get unfairly blocked as well. I am not attempting to circumvent the block, I just needed to message my followers what has happened.

### Alt account discovery

It might be related to the flag on my main account, but my first and main GitHub organization was also flagged.

## Stress

I have been under significant stress during this time period. Things are being delayed, and my future is uncertain. There are many examples of people cloning/forking my repositories, but my official projects are not publicly available at the moment. Additionally, I have received followers while my account was blocked, which I find odd.

## Odd restrictions

I am restricted from searching repository source code by language while logged in, but if I log out/go into private browsing mode, it works just fine.

## Spammy

Upon going to any of my issues or pull requests, I noticed that a label `Spammy` is applied to all my posts. This is additionally what it says:

## GitHub customer support

GitHub customer support has been exceedingly poor. The contact form is taking a very long time, I am not being told why I was flagged, I can't email GitHub (they just blocked my email address when I tried) the forum appears to be moving to GitHub discussions (which will just make it impossible for people with this problem to reach out) and I have not been able to interact with an actual person (not even a bot)
