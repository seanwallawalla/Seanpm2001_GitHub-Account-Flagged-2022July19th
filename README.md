On 2022, Tuesday, July 19th, upon starting my computer, I found that my [main account](https://github.com/seanpm2001/) had been flagged. It retained functionality, except for images not rendering (but none of the files being corrupted) and my entire account being hidden from public view. I have sent a repeal on 2022, July 19th, but as of 7:15 pm PST on 2022, Saturday, July 30th, I have received no response.

</details>

On 2022 July 22nd, I sent another appeal message, as the previous email I used was incorrect. I won't put the image here, as it is pretty much the same, but here is the message sent image:

## Usage of alt account

I was advised to make a message via my alt account. I have been hesitant to do so, as I fear it could get unfairly blocked as well. I am not attempting to circumvent the block, I just needed to message my followers what has happened.

I have plans for after my main account is unflagged, to fork important projects from my main account to my alt account, so that people won't lose all access when this happens. I have already started doing common forks from my alt account, but the main part requires my main account to be up and running first.

### Alt account discovery

It might be related to the flag on my main account, but my first and main GitHub organization was also flagged.

## Stress

I have been under significant stress during this time period. Things are being delayed, and my future is uncertain. There are many examples of people cloning/forking my repositories, but my official projects are not publicly available at the moment. 
It has been extremely stressful for me. On 2022 July 22nd, I reached a bad milestone: I had never been so stressed in my life until that day, and my morale was the lowest it had ever been.

## Follows during suspension

Additionally, I have received followers while my account was blocked, which I find odd.

On 2022, Sunday, July 31st, someone unfollowed me. I am not sure how they are able to access my profile to do this.

## Odd restrictions

I am restricted from searching repository source code by language while logged in, but if I log out/go into private browsing mode, it works just fine.

## Spammy

Upon going to any of my issues or pull requests, I noticed that a label `Spammy` is applied to all my posts. This is additionally what it says:

## GitHub customer support

GitHub customer support has been exceedingly poor. The contact form is taking a very long time, I am not being told why I was flagged, I can't email GitHub (they just blocked my email address when I tried) the forum appears to be moving to GitHub discussions (which will just make it impossible for people with this problem to reach out) and I have not been able to interact with an actual person (not even a bot)

## Reddit post

The Reddit post didn't go as planned. I was met with downvotes, then a snarky reply, then the post was silent until around 1:00 am, when positive posts started coming in. From what I am hearing, it is very possible to get an immediate flag after being reviewed, and that GitHubs spam detection system is having severe problems. I was given the hopeful message "they will get to you eventually" and I was again told the importance of keeping a local server, which is additional support for the idea. Although I have already been starting to become aware of how important a personal server is, this user is now the 3rd person besides me to validate it, increasing the chances that I might actually be able to get one.

I will not leave images of the Reddit post here. The link is down below in the sources.

## Negative impact

The flag has had a highly negative impact on my life and my future. Several opportunities have been missed, and most of my work is now hidden, with other unofficial reproductions now being the only source, most of them are incomplete and infringing.

Thousands of projects have been affected by this. Additionally, contributions to other repositories are now no longer crediting me, and I have missed out on a lot of people discovering my projects.

## Inability to use third party programs

I tried to migrate to GitLab in the meantime, and GitHub finally gave me the reason why my account was flagged:

![/Seanpm2001_Flagged/2022/July19th/No3rdPartySupport/YouAreMarkedAsSpam_Can'tConnectGitLab_2022July22nd_LightMode_1080p.png](/Seanpm2001_Flagged/2022/July19th//No3rdPartySupport/YouAreMarkedAsSpam_Can'tConnectGitLab_2022July22nd_LightMode_1080p.png)

## Discussions locked

I have recently noted on 2022 July 26th that any discussion I currently have or make is automatically locked.

## Codespaces workaround

I can still view image files sparsely by switching over to codespaces (shortcut: `.`) but not all images load here. It is better than GitHub, where none currently load.

## Upload functionality diminishing

Starting on 2022 July 26th, drag and drop upload functionality has a new flaw, it is likely unrelated to the flag. Now each time I go to upload, the drag and drop is denied, and the black GitHub favicon is shown, instead of the white one. I then have to re-drop the files to upload them. This doesn't apply if I upload indirectly (clicking the upload button, rather than just dragging and dropping onto the repository when it isn't in upload mode)

## Attempting to continue normally

Despite the account not being visible publicly, and several things being broken, I have continued to work somewhat normally. I can't let it derail all my progress. During the first 3 days of the flag, I did image file uploads in full, but as of 2022 July 22nd, I have finally made the decision to stop Git-image part A work, but still do Git-image part B work. I have also been rethinking how I will operate after this is over.

## What was done and what should have been done

### What GitHub did

1. GitHub flagged my account and restricted personal view of my own content for both me and others (and also did unnecessary restrictions that can be circumvented by logging out/browsing in private browsing mode)

2. GitHub let a machine be the sole judge of the decision and didn't bother to have a human check first

3. GitHub gave virtually no information on why I was flagged

4. Despite giving no response for 8 days and counting, the decision was not reversed

5. No error logs were made

6. GitHub shut down their forum a few days later, and moved it to GitHub discussions, making it impossible for flagged users to communicate their problem directly

7. GitHub did little to give users a voice, and made it harder by not listening

### What I would do differently

I have learned a lot about what not to do when flagging/blocking/suspending a user from a platform, and I came up with some guidelines last night (2022, Sunday, July 24th, draft V2):

#### Running an online service

##### Avoiding GitHubs 2022 July 19th mistake

###### Basic guidelines

1. If a user is flagged/blocked/suspended, they will still be able to access all content in their account (same as GitHub)

2. A user will be reviewed by a machine first. They will not be blocked yet. A human will then review

3. If/when a problem is detected, a detailed error log will be given

> 1. The error log will have 2 formats: simple and advanced. The simple view will tell of the general problem (with more context than GitHub) and the advanced view will tell you of each individual problem, and how to fix it (along with an auto-fix icon, a button to download the log with a dropdown for simple.<date>.log, advanced.<date>.log, and all.<date>.log, and a button for sending an appeal)

4. If no response is given from the appeal within 12 hours, the user will automatically be unblocked, their content will be publicly reinstated, and the user will be granted immunity for a set amount of time.

5. Logs will be kept privately by default, and the user has the choice to cite it if needed for their followers

6. There will always be a forum that doesn't require an account to be unsuspended to use (even an account terminated from the service can still use the forum, albeit with some limitations that won't prevent them from reporting their problem)

7. There will be a strong user voice, where the user can make their voice heard

###### Additional notes

These rules and guidelines come from a bad personal experience I (@seanpm2001) had with GitHub on 2022 July 19th. I have learned a lot about how NOT to run a service. I feel these 7 rules will be more fair to the user and the community as a whole. Revisions are allowed, but cannot be determimental to the existing rules, features, and functionality.

These rules were made during my first flag/suspension from GitHub, which as of writing this (2022, Monday, July 25th at 12:00 am) is still ongoing. I have extensively researched the issue, and hope to have corrected all flaws with this process, but there might be more, so this is still just a draft.

## GitHub pro

It has been decided that when I get my account back, I will pay the $7.00/month ($84.00/year) for GitHub Pro. This way, I can get better support, and also have the `Pro` label.

## Microsoft

I have become openly critical of Microsoft and GitHub for the first time. This has stemmed from this issue, and the failures that have happened.

## Conclusion

No conclusion is available, as this is still an ongoing issue.

### Aftermath

Aftermath is unavailable, as this is still an ongoing issue.
