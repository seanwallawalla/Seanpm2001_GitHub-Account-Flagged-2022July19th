On 2022, Tuesday, July 19th, upon starting my computer, I found that my [main account](https://github.com/seanpm2001/) had been flagged. It retained functionality, except for images not rendering (but none of the files being corrupted) and my entire account being hidden from public view. I have sent a repeal on 2022, July 19th. I did not receive a response until 2022, Thursday, August 4th at 12:26 am. The suspension was reinstated, and now I have to delete all my organizations before I can review it again, this is going to take a while, then the review is going to take time too.

On 2022 July 22nd, I sent another appeal message, as the previous email I used was incorrect. I won't put the image here, as it is pretty much the same, but here is the message sent image:

## Usage of alt account

I was advised to make a message via my alt account. I have been hesitant to do so, as I fear it could get unfairly blocked as well. I am not attempting to circumvent the block, I just needed to message my followers what has happened.

I have plans for after my main account is unflagged, to fork important projects from my main account to my alt account, so that people won't lose all access when this happens. I have already started doing common forks from my alt account, but the main part requires my main account to be up and running first.

I have been using my alt account on a daily basis to document the ongoing incident.

### Alt account discovery

It might be related to the flag on my main account, but my first and main GitHub organization was also flagged.

As of 2022 August 9th, the organization has been deleted, and my alt account has returned to normal.

## Stress

I have been under significant stress during this time period. Things are being delayed, and my future is uncertain. There are many examples of people cloning/forking my repositories, but my official projects are not publicly available at the moment. 
It has been extremely stressful for me. On 2022 July 22nd, I reached a bad milestone: I had never been so stressed in my life until that day, and my morale was the lowest it had ever been.

## Follows during suspension

Additionally, I have received followers while my account was blocked, which I find odd.

| Original follower count at start of flag/suspension | Gaining a follower during flag/suspension |
|---|---|
| ![Seanpm2001_Flagged/2022/July19th/Follows_DuringSuspension/PNG/483FollowersDuringSuspension.png](/Seanpm2001_Flagged/2022/July19th/Follows_DuringSuspension/PNG/483FollowersDuringSuspension.png) | ![/Seanpm2001_Flagged/2022/July19th/Follows_DuringSuspension/PNG/GainingAFollowerDuringSuspension.png](/Seanpm2001_Flagged/2022/July19th/Follows_DuringSuspension/PNG/GainingAFollowerDuringSuspension.png) |

On 2022, Sunday, July 31st, someone unfollowed me. I am not sure how they are able to access my profile to do this. I went from 484 to 483 followers.

On 2022, Tuesday, August 9th, I randomly lost 2 followers. I went from 483 to 481 followers.

On 2022, Monday, August 15th, I lost 1 follower. I went from 481 to 480 followers.

On 2022, Wednesday, August 17th, I lost 2 more followers, going from 480 to 478 followers.

## Achievements during suspension

Upon logging on on 2022 August 3rd, I found that I had earned the `pair extraordinaire` achievement for a pull request that was opened today. Apparently, any contributions on a public repository automatically credits me as a collaborator, even if it is a fork of the project I have never gone to before. I find it odd that I am earning achievements during the suspension.

## Feedback during suspension

When configuring GitHub actions (as of 2022 August 2nd and onward) I am asked for feedback on how to make actions better. Normally, I respond to these, but I decided not to, regarding the flag, and the lack of response (they likely don't listen to the feedback anyway, judging on how long I have gone without any response)

## Odd restrictions

I am restricted from searching repository source code by language while logged in, but if I log out/go into private browsing mode, it works just fine.

![/Seanpm2001_Flagged/2022/July19th/Can'tSearchPublicRepositories/PNG/XMBC_SCSearch_Denied_2022July19th.png](/Seanpm2001_Flagged/2022/July19th/Can'tSearchPublicRepositories/PNG/XMBC_SCSearch_Denied_2022July19th.png)

## Spammy

![/Seanpm2001_Flagged/2022/July19th/Labels/Spammy/PNG/SpammyLabel.png](/Seanpm2001_Flagged/2022/July19th/Labels/Spammy/PNG/SpammyLabel.png)

Upon going to any of my issues or pull requests, I noticed that a label `Spammy` is applied to all my posts. This is additionally what it says:

![/Seanpm2001_Flagged/2022/July19th/Labels/Spammy/Cropped/PNG/SpammyUsermark_Cropped_2022July19th.png](/Seanpm2001_Flagged/2022/July19th/Labels/Spammy/Cropped/PNG/SpammyUsermark_Cropped_2022July19th.png)

Since it turned out to be my organizations being the problem, I am hoping the `spammy` label doesn't end up being a second issue. I have absolutely no idea what could be considered spammy, my forking sessions (25x) don't feel spammy and don't break any rules. I have still been a bit hesistant with them, but have resumed normally.

On 2022, Saturday, August 13th, the `spammy` label disappeared from all of my issues and pull requests. The issues and pull requests still are not publicly viewable, however.

The removal of the spammy label is a good sign, as it means there likely won't be much further issue upon trying to get my account back. It also delegitimizes snarky comments made against me.

## GitHub customer support

GitHub customer support has been exceedingly poor. The contact form is taking a very long time, I am not being told why I was flagged, I can't email GitHub (they just blocked my email address when I tried) the forum appears to be moving to GitHub discussions (which will just make it impossible for people with this problem to reach out) and I have not been able to interact with an actual person (not even a bot)

## Reddit post

The Reddit post didn't go as planned. I was met with downvotes, then a snarky reply, then the post was silent until around 1:00 am, when positive posts started coming in. From what I am hearing, it is very possible to get an immediate flag after being reviewed, and that GitHubs spam detection system is having severe problems. I was given the hopeful message "they will get to you eventually" and I was again told the importance of keeping a local server, which is additional support for the idea. Although I have already been starting to become aware of how important a personal server is, this user is now the 3rd person besides me to validate it, increasing the chances that I might actually be able to get one.

I will not leave images of the Reddit post here. The link is down below in the sources.

## Negative impact

The flag has had a highly negative impact on my life and my future. Several opportunities have been missed, and most of my work is now hidden, with other unofficial reproductions now being the only source, most of them are incomplete and infringing.

Thousands of projects have been affected by this. Additionally, contributions to other repositories are now no longer crediting me, and I have missed out on a lot of people discovering my projects.

## Inability to use third party programs

I tried to migrate to GitLab in the meantime, and GitHub finally gave me the reason why my account was flagged:

![/Seanpm2001_Flagged/2022/July19th/No3rdPartySupport/YouAreMarkedAsSpam_Can'tConnectGitLab_2022July22nd_LightMode_1080p.png](/Seanpm2001_Flagged/2022/July19th//No3rdPartySupport/YouAreMarkedAsSpam_Can'tConnectGitLab_2022July22nd_LightMode_1080p.png)

## Discussions locked

I have recently noted on 2022 July 26th that any discussion I currently have or make is automatically locked.

![/Seanpm2001_Flagged/2022/July19th/DiscussionLocked/PNG/Can'tVoteOnLockedDiscussions_DiscussionLocked.png](/Seanpm2001_Flagged/2022/July19th/DiscussionLocked/PNG/Can'tVoteOnLockedDiscussions_DiscussionLocked.png)

## Codespaces workaround

I can still view image files sparsely by switching over to codespaces (shortcut: `.`) but not all images load here. It is better than GitHub, where none currently load.

## Upload functionality diminishing

Starting on 2022 July 26th, drag and drop upload functionality has a new flaw, it is likely unrelated to the flag. Now each time I go to upload, the drag and drop is denied, and the black GitHub favicon is shown, instead of the white one. I then have to re-drop the files to upload them. This doesn't apply if I upload indirectly (clicking the upload button, rather than just dragging and dropping onto the repository when it isn't in upload mode)

## Attempting to continue normally

Despite the account not being visible publicly, and several things being broken, I have continued to work somewhat normally. I can't let it derail all my progress. During the first 3 days of the flag, I did image file uploads in full, but as of 2022 July 22nd, I have finally made the decision to stop Git-image part A work, but still do Git-image part B work. I have also been rethinking how I will operate after this is over.

## Finally, a response

On 2022, Thursday, August 4th at 12:26 am, I finally received a response from GitHub support, reinstating the suspension until I delete all of my organizations. This is very very hard on me. It is a huge chunk of my life gone (500-2000+ hours) and it feels like they will bully me into getting rid of other work too.

Despite the issue not being my Git-image part A work, I am still not going to resume the project. I really don't believe that I was domain squatting, but I can't go against them.

I plan on reinstating all organizations on my private server once I get it running.

### Update 1

I am now stuck in a loop starting 2022, Thursday August 4th. I was told in the response to delete my organizations:

![/Email7_Redacted_HighCompression.png](/Seanpm2001_Flagged/2022/July19th/The_First_Response/Email7_Redacted_HighCompression.png)

but when I go to delete them manually, it shows this, telling me to contact them to delete the organizations.

![Organizations_Locked_LightMode.png](/Seanpm2001_Flagged/2022/July19th/OrganizationsLocked/Organizations_Locked_LightMode.png)

So I did, and wrote this really long message, a very, very hard decision for me

![](/Seanpm2001_Flagged/2022/July19th/Appeal_to_delete_all_Organizations/Ticket1731581_afterArchival_LightMode.png)

Then a few hours later, I come back to find that they refused to do the one thing that would fix the problems on both ends.

![Ticket1731581_afterArchival_LightMode.png](/Seanpm2001_Flagged/2022/July19th/GitHub_Refusal/Email2_NoRedaction_HighCompression.png)

I am completely stumped, what do I do?

### Update 2

On 2022, Friday, August 5th, I looked back into the organization pages, and found that the option to delete the organization wasn't græyed out now, so later in the night, I began deleting organizations. I have 2 backup plans to restore them in the future.

I deleted 140 organizations (14% of my organizations) tonight, just the ones without forks. More work will be done to preserve the remaining 860 before I delete them, and it is going to take at least 1 week.

**Deletion log notes:**

**Daily log:**

**Day 0:** _I received the instruction to delete organizations, I tried doing it automatically, which failed, so I planned to start doing it manually the next day._

**Day 1:** _The 140 organizations deleted today don't have in-depth screenshots, as the organizations were empty, and already had screenshot documentation of themselves._

**Day 2:** _80 organizations were deleted today, in-depth screenshots started today as well._

**Day 3:** _I had a difficult time today, and was only able to delete 60 organizations._

**Day 4:** _I now plan to delete 80 organizations per day consistently until I finish deleting all of them._

**Day 5:** _I continued with the plan of deleting 80 per day today. `seanpm2001-all` and `seanwallawalla-forks` were deleted, but still persist on my profile, despite the fact that any user (even me) that visits them gets a 404 error._

**Day 6:** _I accidentally deleted 1 extra organization today._

**Day 7:** _I deleted 79 organizations today, instead of 80, to even out yesterdays mistake. I will continue to delete organizations 80 at a time tomorrow._

**Day 8:** _I went back to deleting 80 organizations per day today. I expect to finish in 4 days. Today, I also have noted that my "what's left" screenshot contains an error (Firefox has been wrapping my username across a whole line of the list) it is possible to be fixed in the future with data and image manipulation._

**Day 9:** _I suffered significant losses today, some of my most important organizations had to be deleted. There were some really special ones today._

**Day 10:** _I finished deleting all non-SNU organizations today. My 'What's left' screenshot also contained no errors today, as the image wasn't wrapped due to how small the selection was._ _Seanpm2001-Ubuntu was deleted today after several linked snaps were no longer available, thus they did not show up in the documentation. It is possible to recreate this data - 2022 August 14th_

**Day 11:** _Only SNU organizations are left, and they all have the same icon. Tomorrow will be the last day of this project._

**Day 12:** _I deleted the last 80 organizations today, which were all SNU organizations. During the last 22 entries, GitHub was deleting organizations by the time I got back to my profile from going back 3 pages, normally, I would have to reload the page first. The project is now complete, and I am contemplating what to do next to try and get my account back. The organization list would be empty if `seanpm2001-all` and `seanwallawalla-forks` would have gone away, but they have persisted for 7 days now._

**Day 13:** _The project was completed yesterday. No data is available to delete. Although, I now notice that the option to `switch to another account` is gone. `seanpm2001-all` and `seanwallawalla-forks` have still not gone away, they have persisted for 8 days now._

**Day 14:** _No data for today, the `seanpm2001-all` and `seanwallawalla-forks` organizations have still not gone away, persisting for 9 days now. I worry it might interfere with my appeal._

**Day 15:** _No data for today, the `seanpm2001-all` and `seanwallawalla-forks` organizations have still not gone away, persisting for 10 days now. I worry it might interfere with my appeal. I sent an appeal tonight._

**Day 16:** _No data for today, although I updated the table to make some enhancements, and fix a spelling error in the title. The `seanpm2001-all` and `seanwallawalla-forks` organizations have still not gone away, persisting for 11 days now. I worry it might interfere with my appeal that was sent last night._

**Additional log:**

The organizations `Seanpm2001-all` and `seanwallawalla-forks` were deleted on 2022, Thursday, August 9th. As of 2022, Sunday, August 14th, they still appear on my profile, despite being completely deleted, with no way for me or anyone else to access them (you just get a 404 page) it has been over 120 hours.

On 2022 Monday, August 8th, I decided to set the amount of orgs deleted per day to 80 (8x8=64) so that I can have a consistent and measured reduction in just 8 days. I expect to finish on 2022, Tuesday, August 16th. If things don't go as planned, it may take longer.

I updated my second account ([`@seanwallawalla`](https://github.com/seanwallawalla/)) on 2022 August 9th, removing the reference to `seanwallawalla-software` and changing the location to match my main account.

I began getting screenshots of the rendered markdown table on 2022, August 15th.

Despite no data before 2022 August 5th, and after August 16th, I still really felt like updating the table to reflect these days.

### Update 3

As of 2022, Tuesday, August 16th, I have deleted all of my GitHub organizations. I am waiting until my family comes back from vacation before I decide what to do next. - 2022, Wednesday, August 17th

I am now deciding on sending a 3rd appeal, I didn't feel like doing so yet today, I am still weighing my options, plus, I was really out of it today and likely couldn't handle the stress regarding sending an appeal. - 2022, Thursday, August 18th

I plan to send an appeal request after I finish work for the day, so that there is minimal interruption if the response is overnight. I might forget, but I will try not to. - 2022, Friday, August 19th

### Appeal message 3

On the night of 2022, Friday, August 19th, I sent a 3rd appeal message:

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this image (appeal message 3)</b></p></summary>

![/Seanpm2001_Flagged/2022/July19th/AppealMessage/2022.08.20/Redacted/PNG/GitHub_Suspension2022_Appeal3_Redacted.png](/Seanpm2001_Flagged/2022/July19th/AppealMessage/2022.08.20/Redacted/PNG/GitHub_Suspension2022_Appeal3_Redacted.png)

</details>

### Update 4

I have also noted that my work using the `@all-contributors` bot was wiped out due to the organizations being deleted, but the attributes now serve as additional proof that the organizations existed, and were used. Suddenly, all my time using this bot no longer feels like a waste. I have not yet received a response to my 3rd appeal yet. - 2022, Saturday, August 20th

No activity has occurred regarding the 3rd repeal, I am still waiting, and still continuing somewhat normally. For some reason, I don't feel entirely prepared to go public again. I should get over this pretty quickly. - 2022, Sunday, August 21st

Still no response. I almost forgot to update this log today. - 2022, Monday, August 22nd

I am still waiting for a response. The difficult question was raised yesterday on what I will do if I never get my account back. - 2022, Tuesday, August 23rd

GitHub sent me a survey at 10:01 pm PST on 2022, Monday, August 8th. Since my issue isn't resolved yet, and I don't want to interfere with it, I chose not to answer this survey. It was stressful receiving an email from GitHub at night due to the ongoing issue.

## What was done and what should have been done

### What GitHub did

1. GitHub flagged my account and restricted personal view of my own content for both me and others (and also did unnecessary restrictions that can be circumvented by logging out/browsing in private browsing mode)

2. GitHub let a machine be the sole judge of the decision and didn't bother to have a human check first

3. GitHub gave virtually no information on why I was flagged

4. Despite giving no response for 15 days and counting, the decision was not reversed

5. No error logs were made

6. GitHub shut down their forum a few days later, and moved it to GitHub discussions, making it impossible for flagged users to communicate their problem directly

7. GitHub did little to give users a voice, and made it harder by not listening

8. GitHub prevented use of third party services during the account flag

### What I would do differently

I have learned a lot about what not to do when flagging/blocking/suspending a user from a platform, and I came up with some guidelines last night (2022, Sunday, July 24th, draft V2):

#### Running an online service

##### Avoiding GitHubs 2022 July 19th mistake

###### Basic guidelines

1. If a user is flagged/blocked/suspended, they will still be able to access all content in their account (same as GitHub)

2. A user will be reviewed by a machine first. They will not be blocked yet. A human will then review

3. If/when a problem is detected, a detailed error log will be given

> 1. The error log will have 2 formats: simple and advanced. The simple view will tell of the general problem (with more context than GitHub) and the advanced view will tell you of each individual problem, and how to fix it (along with an auto-fix icon, a button to download the log with a dropdown for simple.<date>.log, advanced.<date>.log, and all.<date>.log, and a button for sending an appeal)

4. If no response is given from the appeal within 12 hours, the user will automatically be unblocked, their content will be publicly reinstated, and the user will be granted immunity for a set amount of time.

5. Logs will be kept privately by default, and the user has the choice to cite it if needed for their followers

6. There will always be a forum that doesn't require an account to be unsuspended to use (even an account terminated from the service can still use the forum, albeit with some limitations that won't prevent them from reporting their problem)

7. There will be a strong user voice, where the user can make their voice heard

8. Third party services will still be usable to flagged/suspended users, as they are a vital lifeline for transitioning

###### Additional notes

These rules and guidelines come from a bad personal experience I (@seanpm2001) had with GitHub on 2022 July 19th. I have learned a lot about how NOT to run a service. I feel these 7 rules will be more fair to the user and the community as a whole. Revisions are allowed, but cannot be determimental to the existing rules, features, and functionality.

These rules were made during my first flag/suspension from GitHub, which as of writing this (2022, Monday, July 25th at 12:00 am) is still ongoing. I have extensively researched the issue, and hope to have corrected all flaws with this process, but there might be more, so this is still just a draft.

## GitHub pro

It has been decided that when I get my account back, I will pay the $7.00/month ($84.00/year) for GitHub Pro. This way, I can get better support, and also have the `Pro` label.

## Microsoft

I have become openly critical of Microsoft and GitHub for the first time. This has stemmed from this issue, and the failures that have happened.

## Conclusion

No conclusion is available, as this is still an ongoing issue.

### Aftermath

Aftermath is unavailable, as this is still an ongoing issue.
